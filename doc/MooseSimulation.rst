Simulating Moose
=================

Whether you actually have a Moose robot or not, the Moose simulator is a great way to get started with ROS
robot development. In this tutorial, we will go through the basics of starting Gazebo and Rviz and how to drive
your Moose around.

.. note::

  Before you can use this tutorial, make sure you have :doc:`installed Moose's software <MooseInstallation>`


Launch Gazebo
-------------

Gazebo is the most common simulation tool used in ROS. Moose's model in Gazebo include reasonable
approximations of its dynamics, including wheel slippage, skidding, and inertia. To launch simulated
Moose in a simple example world, run the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

    roslaunch moose_gazebo moose_world.launch

You should see the following window appear, or something like it. You can adjust the camera angle by
clicking and dragging while holding CTRL, ALT, or the shift key:

The window which you are looking at is the Gazebo Client. This window shows you the "true" state of the
simulated world which the robot exists in. It communicates on the backend with the Gazebo Server, which
is doing the heavy lifting of actually maintaining the simulated world. At the moment, you're running
both the client and server locally on your own machine, but some advanced users may choose to run heavy
duty simulations on separate hardware and connect to them over the network.

.. note::

    When simulating Moose, you must leave Gazebo running.  Closing Gazebo will prevent other tools, such as
    rviz (see below) from working correctly.

Launch rviz
-----------

The next tool we will encounter is :roswiki:`rviz`. Although superficially similar in appearance to Gazebo,
rviz has a very different purposeâ€” unlike Gazebo, which shows the reality of the simulated world, rviz shows
the robot's *perception* of its world, whether real or simulated. So while Gazebo won't be used with your
real Moose, rviz is used with both.

You can using the following launch invocation to start rviz with a pre-cooked configuration suitable for
visualizing any standard Moose config:

.. code-block:: bash

    roslaunch moose_viz view_robot.launch

You should see rviz appear:

.. image:: graphics/moose_viz.png
    :alt: Moose with laser scanner in rviz.

The rviz display only shows what the robot knows about its world, which presently, is nothing. Because the
robot doesn't yet know about the barriers which exist in its Gazebo world, they're not shown here.


Controlling Moose
--------------------

What is shown, however, is Moose's interactive markers. These are the simplest way to command your robot
to move around. If you don't see them in your rviz display, select the Interact tool from the top toolbar.
You should see red arrows and a blue circle appear around the Moose model.

Drag the red arrows in Rviz to move in the linear x and the blue circle to move in the angular z. Rviz shows you
Moose moving relative to its odometric frame, but it is also moving relative to the simulated world supplied by
Gazebo. If you click over to the Gazebo window, you will see Moose moving within its simulated world. Or, if you
drive real Moose using this method, it will have moved in the real world.

All of Clearpath's robots use the same coordinate system, shown below:

.. image:: graphics/coords.png

===================== ============================= ===================
Axis                  Positive Meaning              Negative Meaning
===================== ============================= ===================
X                     Linear motion forwards        Linear motion backwards
Y                     Linear motion left            Linear motion right
Z                     Linear motion up              Linear motion down
X^ (roll)             Roll to the right             Roll to the left
Y^ (pitch)            Pitch down                    Pitch up
Z^ (yaw)              Rotate left                   Rotate right
===================== ============================= ===================

Moose, in its default configuration, will treat the linear Y & Z axes, as well a the angular X & Y axes, as zero
at all times; the robot is incapable of moving in these directions.

Once you start your own development, have your nodes send ``geometry_msgs/Twist`` commands to the ``cmd_vel``
topic to drive Moose, either real or simulated. This is the standard ROS interface to differential-drive and
holonomic ground vehicles.

The ``geometry_msgs/Twist`` message includes fields for linear X/Y/Z in m/s, as well as fields for angular X/Y/Z
in rad/s.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ rosmsg info geometry_msgs/Twist
    geometry_msgs/Vector3 linear
      float64 x
      float64 y
      float64 z
    geometry_msgs/Vector3 angular
      float64 x
      float64 y
      float64 z

Using a Game Controller
------------------------

You can use a game controller, e.g. a PS4 or Xbox One bluetooth controller, to drive Moose in the simulation.

To do so, first pair your controller with your PC. Once paired, your controller should appear on your system as ``/dev/input/js*``
where ``*`` is a number starting at zero. Make a note of what joy device your controller mapped to, and run the following commands,
substituting ``js0`` as appropriate:

export MOOSE_JOY_TELEOP=1
export MOOSE_JOY_DEV=/dev/input/js0

Then launch Gazebo as described earlier. You should be able to drive Moose by holding the left shoulder button and moving
the left thumb stick.
